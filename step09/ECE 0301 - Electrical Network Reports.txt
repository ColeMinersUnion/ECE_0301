ECE 0301 - Electrical Network Simulation

------------------------------------------------

Data for Electrical Network # 0:
At present, there are 1 Networks in existance.
At present, there are 3 nodes in existance.
Network # 0 has 3 nodes.
Voltage at node 0 = 0
Voltage at node 1 = 12
Voltage at node 2 = 4
Component # 0 is a DC Voltage Source, Vs = 12 Volts.
Component # 0 is connected between node 0 and node 1.
The Voltage across Component # 0 = 12 Volts,
with the negative terminal at node 0.

Component # 1 is a Resistor, R = 200 Ohms.
Component # 1 is connected between node 1 and node 2.
The Voltage across Component # 1 = 8 Volts,
with the negative terminal at node 2.

Component # 2 is a Resistor, R = 100 Ohms.
Component # 2 is connected between node 2 and node 0.
The Voltage across Component # 2 = 4 Volts,
with the negative terminal at node 0.
